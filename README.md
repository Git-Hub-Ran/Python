# My Python Practice Notebooks

Welcome to my Python practice repository!  
Here I document my learning journey with Python, starting from the basics and moving toward more advanced topics.  

## ðŸ“š Notebooks

| Area          | Notebook                                        | What you'll find                       |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Python Basics | [01-python-basics.ipynb](notebooks/python_basics/01-python-basics.ipynb) | Step-by-step Python exercises, explanations, and examples I worked on to strengthen my skills |
| ETL & Data Processing | [02-mini-etl-pipeline.ipynb](notebooks/02-mini-etl-pipeline.ipynb) | A simple ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Python and Pandas, including data extraction from CSV, transformations, and saving processed data |

## ðŸš€ Try it in Colab

You can open these notebooks directly in Google Colab and try the exercises yourself:

I plan to expand this repository with more notebooks in Machine Learning, Generative AI, and coding challenges, so check back for updates!
